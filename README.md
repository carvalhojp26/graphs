# Graphs

## Description
This project aims to apply advanced concepts of graph theory and C programming to solve a computational problem with higher complexity. It involves the integration of data structures, search algorithms, and optimization techniques. The objective is to develop a solution capable of calculating the maximum possible sum of integers from a matrix of arbitrary dimensions, considering specific rules of connection between the integers.

This work is part of the coursework for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the Polytechnic Institute of CÃ¡vado and Ave (IPCA).
